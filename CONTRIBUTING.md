## Creating Predictive Models

When creating, adding, or changing any class that is meant to be a predictive model, be sure that the class extends the *Model*
abstract class. There has been a *Model.java* file added into every directory where a predictive model is present. If you need 
a copy of the *Model.java* file, then just head to the *Linear-Models* directory.

Make sure that code not only works correctly, but it is well written and is legible. In order to keep all Java/JDK versions the same,
please use *at least* Java/JDK version 17.

## Creating Basis Expansions

When creating, adding, or changing any class that is meant to be a basis expansion, be sure that the class extends the *BasisExpansion*
abstract class.
